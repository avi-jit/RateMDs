      "b'My husband and I will be forever grateful to Aina and the entire Sinocare team for helping us to conceive our beautiful, healthy son. We tried to have children for 12 years, and saw doctors and the Zita West Clinic who told us we would never have kids. We needed IVF, and credit our excellent doctor for that, but, crucially, Aina ensured that our ingredients were of the best possible quality. This was not easy - I was 44 when our son was born, and my husband had severe oligospermia, producing between 10-20 sperm (not thousands or millions) most of which were misshapen or dead. Aina guided us, and encouraged us at every turn in her quiet way. We worked very hard to have our son - whatever Aina told us to eat (or not to eat), we ate, when she told me to cut back my work hours, I cut them back. She was always right. It took a year, and getting through a miscarriage from our first IVF, to conceive our son on the second try. Keep an open mind, and persevere with Aina - it is worth it.'\n",

After about 5 months of her treatment, I did another IVF and now produced 17 eggs! From those, I now have a beautiful son! I also saw Alain from SinoCare throughout my pregnancy and it all went smoothly. The only downside is that Aina is really sought after so there is a long wait time when you go to your appointment. But it's all worth it! You just need to plan accordingly and make time for it. \"\n",

Before meeting Aina, I had several doctors appointments to figure why I was having all these miscarriages. I decided to seek another kind of help from Sinocare and that is where I met Aina and her team who treated me and corrected my health issues before getting pregnant the 4th time with a beautiful baby girl. A year after the birth of my first child, I got pregnant again with a son without Aina's treatment as I felt strong and healthy by following Aina's recommendations on how to take care of my health. \"\n",

In early 2014, I suffered from an ectopic pregnancy, resulting in surgery and the removal of one fallopian tube. We then spent 18 months trying to get pregnant again \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unsuccessfully. I was referred to Angie by a friend (also with an incredible success story, in large part due to Angie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acupuncture treatments), and I figured I had nothing to lose by trying acupuncture. I read reviews about her practice and I was excited to begin. Almost immediately (within 4 treatments) I noticed a difference in my stress and anxiety levels. Angie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treatments helped to regulate my cycle within two months of twice weekly treatments. At this time we were also accepted in to the Victoria Fertility Clinic, recommended by Angie, and had our first consultation scheduled for mid-December. After three months of regular treatment, and one day before our consultation, we discovered I was pregnant, and an early ultrasound confirmed that it was not ectopic. Angie continued to provide help with my morning sickness (in the 1st trimester), and baby positioning (late in the 3rd trimester). I am happy to say my beautiful daughter is almost two, and I have started to see Angie again to regulate my cycle, BBT and other minor health concerns. She has been an incredible support with both physical and mental/emotional health and I would highly recommend her to anyone interested in improving their fertility health. '\n",

      "b'One year ago today, Dr. Neelam Sandhu performed an absolute miracle on my wife. I had picked her up from work and she was feeling absolutely horrible. She had a pounding migraine headache and felt like she was going to be sick. She had bags under her eyes and lines on her forehead and looked horrible. She just wanted to go home, but she had an appointment with Dr Sandhu as she was getting great treatments for back pain. we figured that since she would be laying down anyway, it would help her relax. I dropped her off and Dr. Sandhu immediately saw the problems and gave her a different treatment instead. I picked up my wife an hour later only to find her jumping with joy and smiling that her headache was completely gone. The bags under her eyes and the lines on her forehead were also gone. We ended up going out for dinner and had a fantastic evening together. I could not stop staring at my wife as it almost appeared that she had plastic surgery done to remove the bags under her eyes and the lines on her forehead. Her skin tones and face radiated absolutely beautiful! I could not stop staring at her all night! It made for one of the best valentines I have ever had and I have shared this story with many people already. Thank you so much Dr. Sandhu!!! You performed an absolute miracle we will never forget!\\nRandy and Susan'\n",

With Erin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attentive care and support, I finally became pregnant via IVF and now have a beautiful, healthy baby girl. Erin was an integral part of our success in achieving and maintaining a pregnancy. She not only provided the physical care that helped us become pregnant, but each week it was like visiting a friend who listened and offered empathy and kind, positive words and advice that made the hard times more bearable the good news so exciting to share.

That was when I insisted that she - as a plastic surgeon who normally is not part of a panel deciding what treatment a patient should have - be included and have her voice in that decision making. She advocated and supported me through this whole process and thanks to her I opted for another operation versus radiation and no more hormone treatments.

We knew who to contact and all were briefed of what to do while she was away yet they were instructed to contact her immediately. There are not many physicians who go to that length of care as most are more interested in lifestyle than going the extra mile, which makes all the difference in being an exceptional caring doctor versus just being one,.\\nDr. Bovill sees herself as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csilver lining\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an rather dark time for woman with breast cancer and she certainly is!

I went to see Dr. Bovill as she is a member of the cancer care team and she spent more than an hour during the initial meeting to explain in detail all the options available to me. She was very kind and compassionate and helped to alleviate my fears a great deal. And as I started the journey of surgery and treatement, Dr. Bovill did a fantastic job to make me look wholesome and beautiful, even more than my pre-cancer days. This is a perk of having breast cancer if you allow yourself to appreciate it. During the follow-up appointments, she has always treated me with care, patience, and attention. When I felt sad, she actively listened and always said things to comfort and cheer me up. When I felt voiceless (and being a patient I find sometime you don\\'t have much of a voice in your care), she again listens and advocates on my behalf by picking up that phone the early next morning to remind a radiation oncologist that having a successful breast reconstruction is a huge part of breast cancer healing and self image to a young woman, and that it is important to listen to the patient too. The plan changed as a result. Yes, Dr. Bovill is not only a plastic surgeon who is smart, skillful, and detailed oriented, and who peforms surgery to produce a perfect outcome any woman could ask for, but she also does it with actively listening, passion, kindness, compassion, good care, and when the situation is right, an awesome sense of humour. She follows through with your wishes and stands up for you when no one else does. Even my husband says to me when I am anxious about radiation and plastic surgery that \"Dr. Bovill will fix you... she is a perfectionist.\" I feel grateful to have Dr. Bovill as my plastic surgeon. I feel the medical profession is lucky to have her, and this world is a better place because she is in it. If one day I win a lottery, I will share my winnings with her so she can get herself another fantastic racing bike so she can win all the races! Thank you so much Dr. Bovill!'\n",

I also have destroyed 3 ligaments which another specialist has reconstructed. My nerve at the knee level was severed, which now gives me the foot drop syndrome. Dr. Boyd took her precious time and was honest with all my questions. Through that fundamental trust of truthfulness and no promises; and in admiration of her reputation, l took the chance for the fairly new nerve transfer surgery technique. One year later, and the nerve did take to the muscle. Dr. Boyd has performed my second operation and the scarring on the skin is minimal compared to the first one done by another specialist.

She considers everything from the types of foods you should be eating & avoiding before surgery, vitamins to take weeks in advance, before, & after the surgery. In my experience, she truly cares about the patient. She made several calls to me to ensure I was feeling well post op and continued to be very thorough throughout the healing time.

Her surgical skills are amazing and her attention to detail so much appreciated by my Type A self! I was diagnosed with breast cancer 22 months ago, and at the recommendation of my surgical oncologist, I met with Dr. Choi, who was incredibly compassionate and comforting to a woman who had just learned the day before that her breast cancer would necessitate a mastectomy. To say that my head was spinning and that I was super stressed would be an understatement. I walked into Dr. Choi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office crying, but knowing exactly what surgical path I wanted to take. After a physical exam and review of my medical history, we had an extensive conversation about the procedure and recovery. She and her professional, friendly, and helpful medical and administrative staff somehow managed to pull off scheduling all the necessary pre-surgical testing and other arrangements so that I was in the operating room nine days after my initial appointment with her. SuperSurgeon and SuperStaff, indeed. At my second pre-op appointment, Dr. Choi reviewed everything we had discussed the week prior and wanted to be sure I fully understood the procedure and the recovery, both short term and long term, as well as follow-up procedures, should I choose to continue the reconstruction to its most aesthetic conclusion (YES!). She never rushed me, giving me all the time I needed to ask questions and to cry, of course. I was 100% confident in her abilities and that of my surgical oncologist and was eager to have my surgery so that I could get on the road to recovery. Never having really thought much about my breasts before my diagnosis, I all of a sudden cared so much about them, so to have a surgeon like Dr. Choi understand what was important to me was comforting. Of course, having healthy breasts is the most important factor here, but I must say that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m quite pleased with my beautiful new breasts that Dr. Choi \\xe2\\x80\\x9csculpted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for me. I would never have believed that such a perfect result could be possible, and that my breasts could actually have a better shape after reconstruction than did my original pair. I have seen Dr. Choi on a regular basis since my surgery, and at each visit, she is as kind and caring as she was when we first met. Her staff is just as committed to excellence as is Dr. Choi. I would recommend Dr. Choi to anyone facing breast reconstruction or for any plastic surgery needs. To be faced with such a devastating diagnosis, then to have such a positive outcome has been life changing for me, both physically and psychologically. Dr. Choi played, and continues to play, a major role in this adventure. Thank you, Dr. Choi!'\n",

      "b\"Some time ago I have a disastrous outcome on breast surgery. My husband and I scoured the internet to see who might be able and willing to fix this mess. Since Dr. MacLennan had such good ratings, we took a chance on her. Well, what a great decision. This doctor is an artist. Her skill level is matched only by the sense of confidence she instills in her patients. Her manner is calm, she listens fully and important, she understood the negative implications my prior surgery had on body image. It was a complicated and time consuming procedure that required two visits to the operating room. Her work is meticulous and beautiful. I could not be happier and will be forever grateful for Dr. MacLennan's time, attention and her exquisite work. The office staff are professional, very friendly and followed-up every step of the way. Would I recommend Dr. MacLennan? I would say you'd be foolish to go elsewhere.\"\n",

He performed breast augmentation for me in February of 2018 and now, in June, I can say with confidence that I am very pleased with the results. I sought out Dr. Rad after consulting with a couple of other plastic surgeons and reading up on his exceptional credentials. After doing my homework, it seemed clear to me that he would be the best choice. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Dr. Rad is even better in person than he is on paper. His bedside manner is impeccable. Dr. Rad made me feel respected, cared for, and always well informed. He is honest, patient, warm, and genuine. He took time to answer all of my questions with thoughtful and complete answers that were neither dumbed down nor medically confusing to a lay person. His staff is also a shining example of polished professionalism, cheer, and discretion. They were always accessible and prompt in responding to my communications. And lastly, the offices of Sherber and Rad are beautiful, modern, and private with a welcoming feel more akin to a spa than a sterile doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. I feel extremely lucky to have had access to Dr. Rad who put my mind at ease and gave me a physical result that exceeds what I had hoped for. '\n",

He and his staff are welcoming, conscientious, and provide excellent quality of care to their patients. The appointments never felt rushed and Dr. Rad will answer any and all questions you have (even if you're like me and need things explained to you 100 different times)!\\nIn the end, my results speak for themselves--over-filled saline implants switched out for silicone ones have provided much more comfort with the implants over all (I can lay on my stomach again!), and the capsular contracture has been completely taken care of. Absolutely no more pain.\\nIn addition, Dr. Rad suggested a fat transfer to take care of the dimple beneath my right nipple. I have always been self conscious of my chin, and asked if it would be possible to take fat from there for the procedure. Despite the general method being fat taken from the abdomen, Dr. Rad was happy to accommodate, and now, no more strange nipple dimple and an under chin area I am much more confident about! Everything is even more beautiful than the first time around.\\nOverall, I would not recommend anyone but Dr. Rad to a friend or family, no matter what procedure they're seeking. Dr. Rad and his team will make sure you're taken care of. \"\n",

Then I met the artist that is Dr. Pirani and am amazed he was able to create such beautiful balance.

      "b\"I'm already a huge Dr. Hani Sinno fan. I found him here, on RateMDs. I liked that he specialized in breast reconstruction for breast cancer patients, and once I'd found him I remembered that I'd heard wonderful things about him from two random strangers! His reviews, and that of his assistant, Nashrin Bashar, were amazing. They were convincing enough for me to make an appointment for a consultation. I was so nervous that I barely spoke at first (if you knew me you'd know how unusual that is) but Dr. Sinno put me at ease. He's professional, passionate, positive and kind. He took all the time with me that I needed, and by the time I left I'd booked an appointment for an upper bleph (my eyelids looked like a sharpei's). It made perfect sense to me, at that moment, to have him do surgery on my face to see if I could trust him with my breasts, lolol! I was thrilled with the results of the bleph, and I have such confidence in his skill and judgement that I gave him free rein with my lipo and breast shape. I'm SO glad I did. Artists gonna art, baby. I had my bleph in early June of last year, and my surgery date for my RAMQ covered breast reduction and accompanying lipo was June 1st. Soo owrth the wait, and even at 5 days post-op, I can see and feel an enormous difference. I wish I'd done this years ago, and yet I'm so grateful I got to do it now. I've seen a few comments about punctuality here, and while I understand the concern with a tight schedule, I think his attention to his patients is invaluable. When I went for my very first consultation, I drove down from the Laurentians. I knew I'd have to leave at a certain time, whether he was able to see me or not, because I had to pick up my son. Nashrin gave me a running update, and sure enough I had to leave without seeing him. But you know what? That's what really sold me. He was late because he was coming out of surgery. He was NOT going to rush a surgery for a consultation, never mind that a brand new patient might feel inconvenienced and decide to go with someone else. I said to myself on my way back up, THAT is what what I want in a surgeon. My instincts were rewarded; It's rare to meet such authentic and generous people as Hani and Nashrin. They've moved into a beautiful new office with a fantastic staff; you'll feel like a star when you go for a consultation or treatment. That said, I'm so glad I met them when they were still in the starter office. The intimacy of the place made me feel like I'd found long-lost family members. (Edit - I wrote much of this on RealSelf before my surgery, and I've already had my 1st post-op appointment. Dr. Sinno, in addition to being a sculptor, is an architect and designer. He designed the space himself, and I felt even more comfortable and happy there this time than I did at the old place) I know all this praise may seem a little over the top if you haven't met them, but it's straight from the heart. I love these guys, and will always hold them in great affection and respect. Family! Much love, Hani and Nashrin - see you July 17th for my 6 week follow up! xo M\\n\"\n",

But I think I tried every other thing on the market! Finally, in my early 40\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the active outbreaks began to subside. I was left with terrible acne scars which were so embarrassing that I dared not go outside without extensive makeup which resulted in only partial cover up of my appearance. I began looking into ways that I could improve my appearance. There was so much conflicting information on the internet. After one doctor promised that he could help me, I had several treatments with a fractional laser which ended up doing absolutely nothing! Then I found Dr. Kass. I could not believe how patiently he explained his philosophy on the treatment of deep acne scars and he explained that no one single treatment is best. Instead, he used a combination of procedures to achieve the best possible results. I elected to proceed with Hetter Facial Resurfacing, punch excisions where necessary, as well as subcision of select scars with Silikon 1000 injections. It has now been three months since my last injection and I cannot explain what a difference these treatments have made in my life and in my self esteem. Although I still see my acne scars, I know that they are about 80% improved compared to what they were before treatment. I am so indebted to Dr. Kass that these words of gratitude fail to do justice to what he has done for me. I would recommend that anyone who is embarrassed by acne scars see Dr. Kass for treatment. He is worth every penny that I paid him!'\n",

The office is very beautiful and clean, creating a warm environment from the beginning. My consultation was for a breast augmentation with a lift. This was going to be my first ever surgery and I admit I was not very knowledgeable about the whole process. Dr. Edwards took his time explaining the pre procedures, surgery, and post procedures very thoroughly. He made me feel so comfortable and we talked as if I'd known him for months! His demeanor is professional but he speaks with you almost like you're a family member or close friend, which I loved. I went to a couple other consultations prior to Dr. Edwards and while his costs are slightly higher, there was no doubt in my mind I was getting my procedure anywhere else. My surgery went great and I am beyond happy with my results. I could go on and on and write about how accommodating ALL staff involved were which each and every step of the process but then you'd be reading for quite some time. Take my advice and book your consultation to see for yourself, you won't be disappointed! \"\n",

      "b'I could write a novel of good things to say about Dr. Edwards and his team. (I\\'ll write a short one instead.). I went to Dr. Edwards four years ago for a consultation and knew then that he had to be my surgeon. (whenever that time was going to come.) I was only 20 at the time and he told me he thinks it would be best that I wait a couple of years and I am so thankful I did. Four years later I walked back into his office for yet another consult and he comes in the room and remembered who I was. What surgeon, who sees hundreds of patients remembers someone that he saw for maybe an hour, four years ago? This gentleman, he truly is amazing. Like all consults I tried on sizers and we ended up choosing 345cc moderate profile for my right breast and either a 295,310, or 330 cc\\'s in my left breast. (My left breast is about 50ml\\'s larger then my right). Which him and his wonderful talented team would decide on in surgery while they checked sizing to see what looked best on my frame.\\nThe day of surgery finally came and I was freaking out. Nervous, excited, anxious, scared, name an emotion and I was feeling it. I was shaking, could barely talk, and then Dr. Edwards walked into my waiting room and instantly I was at ease. We discussed everything that was going to be happening, went over implant sizes one more time and he reminded me that \"Your breast are sisters, not twins\" and I then insisted that whatever 4 implants looked best on my body and most natural to put those in.\\nDr. Bowman (the anesthesiologist) also came in to my room and talked to me before as well. He looked over my charts and we talked about my fasciotomy that I had a couple years back. He is just as sweet and amazing as Dr, Edwards.\\nDr. Edwards bedside manner is just as amazing as his work. He walked beside my bed into the surgery room, talked to me, and held my hand to calm me down until I was asleep. And when I woke up he was there checking on things and told me he already talked to my mom who was in the waiting room, that I did amazing and that my results were already beautiful!\\nToday exactly one month later I am beyond happy with my results. They are the perfect size and so natural looking already. (Which is what I wanted.) There are no words to express how thankful and in love I am with my results, and with Dr. Edwards and his team. I got the exact dream results I was looking for and wanted for 7+ years.\\nIf you\\'re as picky as I am, and want someone that can and will exceed your expectations then I without a doubt recommend and urge all you ladies to go to Dr. Edwards and his astonishing team. I know you will not be disappointed.\\nThank you Dr. Edwards, Dr. Bowman, Cathy, and Jacqueline, for all you\\'re patience, love, and beautiful work!! '\n",

      "b'My liposuction story actually began about 25 years ago. I have always struggled with my weight, and went on my first real diet at the age of 10. I lost 14 kgs at that time .... And have been dieting ever since. There has never been a stage in my life that I could let my guard down and eat whatever I wanted, it\\'s been a never-ending battle.\\nAs I got older, my shape became more defined - a pear shape, that is! It runs in my family and I was no different -actually, I was - because I was blessed with the most prominent pear shape of all!\\nAs the years progressed and I gave birth to 3 beautiful girls, my shape became the bane of my existence. I dieted no end, exercised until I was collapsing and saw a dietician on a weekly basis.\\nAnd then...... My life changed. I made the \"Liposuction Decision\" to accomplish what I simply could not do alone! Using Dr Lanzer was a natural choice for various reasons, one being that a friend had used him in the past for liposuction and has never looked back, and another being that he had personally carried out this procedure more than 15,000 (!!) times, which obviously meant that I had complete confidence in him.\\nWhat can I say?? Dr Lanzer was just incredible - the procedure was a dream ! I was operated on at about 2 pm in the afternoon- under general anaesthetic - and was taking the kids to school the next morning! I simply cannot speak highly enough about Dr Lanzer and his staff!\\nFrom the initial consultation right through to post-surgery check-ups, I was treated with the utmost care, dignity and professionalism. The staff were well-informed, efficient and always ready to answer any questions I had. My calls and emails were always promptly returned. The nurses were so wonderful and warm and Dr Lanzer was so approachable throughout.\\nThe recovery was a non-event and the bruising stage passed very quickly. I was finally able to wear clothes that I hadn\\'t dared to look at in many years.\\nPeople ask me if I have any regrets. Well, to be honest, I do. I regret that I struggled pointlessly for so many years and didn\\'t do liposuction sooner!'\n",

      "b'Dr. Rothfeld is highly talented and skilled technically superior facial cosmetic surgeon. I shopped around for years before I let someone perform cosmetic surgery to my face. The Dr. addressed all of my concerns and determined the exact amount of lift to achieve my beautiful new look. I was worried I would not look natural or be a distorted version of myself. It took me 52 years to be comfortable in my skin, I just wanted it a little tighter. Dr. Rothfeld came highly recommended from a friend who is in the cosmetic industry and that held a lot of weight for me. What made me decide to choose the doctor is that he listens first. He spent a lot of time with me, getting a good idea of who I am and what I wanted. He answered all of questions, made himself available for more questions as they came along. His work is impeccable and I am so very happy with the results. People always tell me how great I look, not one person asks me what I had done. He is a truly a gifted artist and sees the human face as a talented, brilliant sculptor like Donatello, who understands contours and shapes with an eye for perfect symmetry that places him well above the abilities of most cosmetic physicians anywhere. I am a completely different person after my procedure a year ago. Very Confident and feeling so beautiful about myself. I recommend Dr. Rothfeld to any women or man.'\n",

The doctor who was treating me felt he couldn\\'t do anything more so he referred me to Dr. Gregory Weinstein of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. I didn\\'t realize at that time it was the best thing that could have happened to me. From the initial consultation which lasted almost two hours through each follow up visit, Dr. Weinstein was the ultimate professional. He addressed all of my concerns, and I never once felt like I was being rushed out of his office. He performed both a tongue and neck dissection and after each surgery he informed me what to expect during the recovery and each time he was spot on. Whenever I talk with someone who knows Dr. Weinstein or knows of him they speak of him with utmost respect and highest of praises. Whenever given the opportunity I gladly pass on his name and phone number to potential patients because I truly believe he is the best.\\nDr. Weinstein surrounds himself with very dedicated and caring associates who make each patient\\'s issues their #1 concern. Everyone I have ever met there has always been very kind, caring, knowledgeable, and compassionate. One of the nurses even told us that they realize most people who come into their office have serious medical issues and the last thing they need is to come there and be greeted by someone with an attitude.\\nMarch 2015 marked my five year follow up anniversary so I was officially \"cured\" and released from Dr. Weinstein\\'s care. When I first started I didn\\'t think I would make it this far, but thanks to Dr. Weinstein and his team here I am feeling great, enjoying life, and able to spend lots of quality time with my beautiful family.\\n'\n",

Once he was done he showed me the xray, and it looked beautiful. I knew my roots were curved, which makes the root canal more difficult, but he did an amazing job. The whole office was superb, from the front desk, to the assistant, and Dr. Chahal. Thank you again for your care, and I'll be back if I ever need another root canal.\"\n",

When I returned to shore, Dr. Wisniewski happened to be there as well and for that happenstance, I'll be forever grateful. Since there was no hospital or medical clinic where I was, Dr. Wisniewski assessed my injury and told me I would need stitches. He also informed me that on every trip he takes, he carries a first aid kit--with stitches, anesthetic and a syringe with him just in case. I could not have been luckier to run into Dr. Wisniewski. He took me to his hotel and completed the procedure. I walked out of there with 3 beautiful stitches. He treated me as if I was in the hospital; I have never been more comfortable with a doctor in my life. Thanks to him, I didn't have to walk around with an infected gash on my head. Unfortunately I live in California, otherwise I would consider flying to Montreal just to have him treat me. Anyone would be fortunate to have Dr. Wisniewski treat them. He is truly the best!\"\n",

      "b'First off let me say my journey is probably different than most. I have been a fitness professional and bodybuider for 17 years. When I turned about 32 I started having hormonal issues that caused my body to store more body fat than I ever had. I was very depressed and extremely unhappy with my appearance. I was no longer able to think about competing in fitness competitions, and I just didn\\'t look like myself anymore. Unfortunately, I was a VERY rare case that was going through extremely early menopause by 35. It wasn\\'t a lot of body fat that I was storing but enough to upset me since I\\'ve lived all my life training and being extremely lean. I used to have 8% body fat, but then when the menopause started I went up to about 13%.\\nI was desperate for help and started my journey of researching cosmetic surgeons who could perform liposuction. I knew I wanted the Vaser HD lipo technology, because it was the most advanced and geared more for someone like me who wanted to show the cuts in their muscle definition.\\nI went on 10, yes 10 consultations. Every single surgeon either turned me down because they thought I already was lean enough, or they just didn\\'t understands my needs, and treated me the same as everyone else. Again, I am a very rare case, so I needed someone who could treat me as such.\\nThen on my lucky number 11th consultation, I found Dr. Greenberg. I knew then moment I met him, he was the one. This man was everything I was looking for. He took the time to listen to my struggles, and he understood that I was not a typical lipo candidate. He is the most kind and gentle person you would ever want to speak with. However he is also very honest and straightforward, and sets realistic expectations on what he can achieve. I could tell when I met him he was extremely passionate about what he does, and he takes pride in his patients satisfaction and well being.\\nI booked lipo of the entire legs, knees, and triceps. In a week I will be going back to do a small section of fat on my lower back.\\nI didn\\'t know what to expect with the outcome, but even if he was able to make me look 50% better, I would have been relieved. I never would have imagined that he was able to give me the true results I was praying for. I was absolutely blown away. He went above and beyond anything I had anticipated. I know he took the time to go into extra detail while performing my surgeries. He literally carved my body like an ice sculpture. It was beautiful! There is a true level of talent and art that goes into this, and he really does have it all. My body now looks the way it used to when I was 25. I am no longer sad and depressed, but I feel absolutely wonderful and extremely confident again.\\nDr. Greenberg was truly a Godsend for me. He changed my life in ways I don\\'t even think he\\'ll ever know. This was the most important decision I have ever made with my body, and I couldn\\'t be happier that I finally found the person I was looking for to help me.\\nIf you are thinking of any cosmetic surgery procedures, there is no reason to search any further. Trust me, I\\'ve seen all the \"top\" doctors in Dallas for consultations, and no one could even come close to this man. He is simply the best and most passionate in his field, and I will recommend him forever! 10 stars across the board!\\nIn addition, his Medical Assistant Summer and Patient Coordinator Kelly are just the best! You can tell they really get along well, and they all work together like a little family. These girls are absolutely wonderful, friendly, polite and just a pure joy to be around. Summer has been treating me for months with sonograms to loosen up scar tissue and I have become very fond of her, and I love our sessions, plus she is just the best at the massage with her little device. I love that girl! They will all take excellent care of you, and are just as dedicated as Dr. Greenberg. '\n",

I somehow stumbled onto the lipoabdominoplasty procedure which can be performed in office with no overnight hospital stay and without the longer recovery time of general anesthesia and I was intrigued. Then I met Dr. Greenberg and I knew I had found the one :) He was also able to do a breast fat transfer at the same time and words cannot describe how thrilled I am with my new, completely natural, beautiful breasts! He did a fantastic, fantastic job. I will be going back to him without hesitation to try to improve my thighs from a bad lipo experience (different Dr.) done 30 years ago on my thighs that I haven't been able to get any plastic surgeon to even consider trying to help me with. He showed me pic's of a thigh lift he performed on another patient that looked amazing and he gave me hope for the first time in 30 years that my problem can be greatly improved. I love that he's learning the latest and greatest techniques and that he thinks outside the box a little. He does an outstanding job using less invasive procedures in his own surgical center without using general anesthesia...so in the end, your cost is reduced substantially, you recover quicker and you have amazing results.

From the first visit, we were impressed with how kind, knowledgeable, and caring she was. She was confident in my ability to have a natural, at home birth. Not only did Maeve make sure I was physically healthy, she made sure I was emotionally healthy. In between prenatal appointments, I would receive texts saying how she was praying for me and asking how I was feeling. She was able to communicate any concerns she had with tact and kindness and never pushed anything I wasn't comfortable with. When it came closer to my son's birth, she reminded me how confident she was in my ability to have a happy, healthy birth. She was in tune with my every need as I labored and after my son's birth. I could not have asked for a better midwife to be there or a more beautiful birth. Unfortunately, I had to go to ER a few days after because of complications of the birth. I was terrified and confused but Maeve was able to help my husband and I navigate through the whole, ugly process. She recommended a doctor she trusted, came to visit me after the procedure to make sure I was alright, and even helped us with insurance troubles. Her postpartum care was just as stunning as her prenatal care. She continues to check in on me, to this day. She will definitely be my midwife for my next baby!

Based on in-depth questions and his expertise, he was able to discern the correct remedy to address my lack of a sense of well being, calmness, clarity and energy. After about four months on this remedy I feel really wonderful. I'm pharmaceutical free. And each week I progress toward ever more joy and wholeness. He also explains well how this all works. It's a fascinating learning process. It's beautiful how this method of healing honors the workings of the human mind and body so effectively.

If you are lucky enough to have everything go well you could look past the horrible staff and the ridiculous wait times. However, if you are one of the unlucky ones that have a complication from your surgery, he will deny anything is wrong and treat you so poorly from that point on that you have no choice but to find another doctor to fix his mistakes. I know of three patients, myself being one of them that lost their joy of life after having a surgery that didnt take. He used to have a large practice in Jacksonville and packed up and left, now he is in Brandon taking on so much that even with a PA he still will not admit something needs to be fixed, even if the failure is visible from just lost king at the victim. I suspect he is jamming as many patients in as he can and will be packing up before the law suits catch up with him here too.\\nHe obviously is good when he gets it right, but will refuse to fix you if it's done correctly. I originally rated him highly because he did such a beautiful job, but when there was s verse pain and a build up of fluid he denied it and I had to go elsewhere to get it fixed. But I will never be the same. So it's a roll of the dice, if you do go and have a problem, and you start to get brushed off don't wait for him to fix it. Go somewhere else and use your ability to have a second opinion. It might save you from losing everything as I have as well as two others. You will be signing something that states that it's not the doctors fault if your prosthetic doesn't take. And anything he puts in your spine fluke a fusion is considered a prosthetic. \"\n",

When Dr. Capone told me in 2001 when I was initially a stage I, that my first CT scan (in 2001) noted tumors in my liver and lung, I was now a stage IV, she was practically in tears. Her attire is very much appropriate. True she does not wear a white robe, but very nice clothes, keeps up with fashion; she is a beautiful and intelligent young woman and dress's accordingly. Not once have I thought she dressed too revealing. By her recommendation I have had cutting edge treatment like CiberKnife, she is open to second opinions and very much takes in account my overall feelings. Dr Capone has many patients and does not have unlimited time to spare when attending to her daily appointments. But when she has an emergency or special situation she gives all that is needed.

I was not getting everything explained to me like they do at Berkeley and after seeing Dr Doe, I decided to have my records transferred to him at Berkeley Eye Center and he just performed the cataract removal of my right eye and will do the other in June. Dr Doe is also very nice and caring and he explained the entire procedure honestly and I was not nervous going into surgery. He also prayed with me and being a Christian I really appreciated that.

      "b'I develop dryness in my eyes about 3 or 4 years ago. At that time I went to see a group of physicians in the Boynton Beach area and after that I went to see another group in Palm Beach Gardens. After that group I then went to see another set of physicians in the Boca Raton area. One of my friends recommended an eye doctor in the Delray Beach area and after seeing all four of them I realized that all of them are trained about the same and are pretty much very basic in their methodologies. Each of them prescribed artificial tears of different types and put plugs in my tear ducts. One gave me Restasis that burned. It was after that that I asked one of my friends who has dryness of her eyes who he uses and he says that she uses the doctors at Palm Beach Eye Center specifically Dr. Wallshein and that his physician recommended. I called my VIP internist and asked who she used and I got a different answer. It was something like here are 3 names, and in a softer voice \"but all the doctors in the area use this last one on the list, Dr Wallshein.\" She said \"so do I.\" So I was in his office and he starts listening to my case and after 5 mins of my experience, he just asked me to stop right there and basically requested that he be allowed to do some dry testing on the spot. It was done and it was determined that I have multiple problems leading to my condition and he said that artificial tears and plugs were never going to be an effective way to treat it. So I\\'m supposed to believe this one and not everyone else? My wife and I was shocked and so we left the office. I requested my medical records and ended up going to another physician in the Fort Lauderdale area who than recommended once again artificial tears, plugs and this time a steroid. After doing this for several months with no improvement, I decided to return to Palm Beach Eye Center to discuss my case further. The doctor asked where I had been for so long and I said that I decided to get another opinion. We both smiled. To be honest I thought the doctor was looking to get some extra money because there was a test that was not covered by insurance of $40. He said he wished everything was covered as well because it would certainly be a lot easier to treat patients in an effective way. Anyway after multiple years of all my problems, Dr Wallshein made a treatment plan and I followed it. It\\'s been 2 months now that I saw the good doctor and I feel great. My eyes are perfect and I sleep great at night. I can use the computer all day long. I cannot tell you how this is changed my life and I cannot tell you how wrong people can be and short-sighted. Anyway I\\'m just very pleased with this doctor. My wife had cataract surgery and had an absolute beautiful outcome with 20/20 vision distance and near. My daughter now sees him and she\\'s very happy with her new contact lenses. I highly recommend this practice to all my friends. They are truly ethical smart and are thinking outside the box when it comes to treating conditions that nobody else does and I mean this literally as I saw just about everyone else. '\n",

      "b'I will tell you a story about this amazing physician that sums it up beautifully. I was scheduled for my lens exchange surgery a few weeks ago and was obviously anxious about the idea of operations on my eyes. When I arrived at the facility there seems to be quite a buzz around his staff and I eventually found out that he was breaking a national record that day for cases. His staff seemed so excited but my anxiety only heightened on hearing this. I did not want to be treated like a number or a cog in a factory especially being so nervous to begin with. Luckily these anxieties were immediately eliminated on meeting Dr Sanghera. He greeted me with a big and beautiful smile and gave all the time I needed to discuss my case and expectations. I never felt rushed at all. The surgery was equally pleasant. It was obviously easy for this super surgeon (about 4-5 minutes) but his calming voice kept my blood pressure from rising. Afterwards, my post operative visits have been remarkable. I see crystal clear for all distances with just some dry eyes which is par for course. I now see clearer than I can ever remember seeing in all my life. So there it is. I had eye surgery from a record breaking super surgeon who possesses an exemplary bed side manner and calming personality. I never felt rushed in the slightest and he has absolutely delivered on my expectations for vision outcome. What else can you ask for? As Canadians we should be proud to have such high quality medical professionals serving us without having to mortgage our homes for their exceptional care.

      "b'\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: leeda@surgerycenteraz.com\\nSent: Thursday, August 18, 2016 12:17pm\\nTo: \"Leeda Roshan\" <lroshan11788@yahoo.com>\\nSubject: reviews\\nI would highly recommend Dr. Spencer Wilson to my family, friends or anyone else in need of a Oral Surgeon. Dr. Wilson and his staff are the absolute very best at what they do. I have never been so impressed with the quality of patient care and treatment that I received from his practice. The entire staff were all very professional, welcoming, informative, courteous and kind. They use state of the art technology.\\nDr. Wilson took the time to get to know me as a person and took note of my wishes and concerns. Dr. Wilson was able to come up with a treatment plan specifically for me...probably one of his more challenging patients. He provided me with options to choose from and let me decide on what I wanted to proceed with. I never felt any pressure from him or any of his staff members. He was able to help put my mind at ease, calm my anxieties and make me feel as comfortable as humanly possible. I was always treated with kindness, respect and dignity. Dr. Wilson informed me of what to expect during and after my surgery. There were no surprises.\\nIt is very nice to have a Oral Surgeon who takes pride in his work and who has the best work ethics. Knowing that I am sort of a perfectionist, he went above and beyond to give me the desired look I wanted to achieve. He didn\\'t take any \"shortcuts\" or have that \"good enough\" mentality. He truly cares about his patients and their well being. He is a very humble man. Every time I tried to thank him and give him credit for all that he has done for me...he never took all the credit himself. He was always the first person to remind me that it was a \"team effort\" and he was just one part of it.\\nHe has a wonderful team of ladies that work for him. You can just tell that everyone there in the office love what they do and enjoy working for him...and that says a lot about the Doctor they work for.\\nThe evening of my surgery (after office hours...on his own personal time...taking time away from his own family), he personally called me to check to see how I was. He gave me his personal cell phone number in case I may have had any issues, concerns or questions. I was \"tickled pink\" with the beautiful flower arrangement that he had delivered to me while I \"recovered\" from my surgery. The extra \"little\" details didn\\'t go unnoticed and were greatly appreciated.\\nDr. Wilson is the \"Rock Star\" of all Oral Surgeons. He is the \"Jon Bon Jovi\" of all Oral Surgeons. Anyone who knows of me personally, knows that this is the highest compliment that I could ever give anyone. Hopefully, I will never be in need of a Oral Surgeon again for myself, but, in the event that I do, I know who I will be calling. Only the best for myself, family and friends. Just love him!\\nDr. Wilson by far exceeded my expectations with giving me that \"Million Dollar Smile\" that I never thought would be possible but, have always dreamed of.\\nFrom his most appreciative patient...\\n~Jessica~'\n",

      "b\"Best experience ever. I went in for my consultation and right off the back DR. Koos made me feel very comfortable. He explained the full procedure how he would perform it and what I should expect. The office setting is beautiful, modern and clean. The staff is also very helpful. I was a bit skeptical ok getting my wisdom teeth pulled in the beginning. I had an extra wisdom tooth and thought that would be problematic. Dr Koos reassured me that it wouldn't and that he has taken out a max of 12 at once. I went in first thing on a Saturday for the appointment, staff had notified me two days before that I couldn't eat after 12am. So once I arrived I was ready. Dr Koos greeted me and asked was I ready to take a nap \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xb4 as I followed staff into the operation room. The whole time it was all about me they asked what music I wanted to here then asked how I was doing as each steep was explained, reviewed the preformed. By the end of the second song Dr Koos prepared me for my nap and 10 seconds later I was KO. I don't fully recall waking up but vividly remember everything else leading up to the explanation of how to take the medication prescribed that was given to my boyfriend and also being helped to the car. Which I was able to walk to I really forgot the name of the guy that helped out I want to say Keith, with him Dr Koos and Nancy who all I could remember just said hi I loved it. Today is day two a little swelling nothing major and minimal pain. I have never been so happy to go to a dentist ever. Then last night I got a personal call from Dr Koos (hints the dog barking in the back) checking on me. I would highly recommend Ora Surgery to any one anytime. Thanks everyone involved for making this quick and easy.\"\n",

      "b'Dr. Heckler treated a few of our children with braces. Not only did our kids adore her and look forward to every visit, because she was always so kind to them. She made sure to ask them about what was going on in their life besides for their teeth and gave very practical advice for how to take care of their teeth too.\\nOur kids love to show off their new beautiful smiles to everyone.\\nThe office and staff is always clean and punctual.\\nTam, the secretary, is always patient and kind too.'\n",

      "b'We knew that our youngest was going to need braces just like his older siblings and we always knew that the only practice we would take him to was Bridgham Barr Orthodontics. Our two older children had their orthodontic work done by Dr. Bridgham and we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been happier, not only with the end result, but with the entire process. And we have not been disappointed this time around.\\nI know children who had their braces put on at a very young age. Many of them had their braces on for years or had problems later with crowding. Dr. Bridgham and Dr. Barr don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in rushing the process. They wait for a more mature dental age to start. I truly believe this is a sign of advance orthodontristry and professionalism.\\nOur oldest child had extreme crowding due to size of his palate. Our dentist was concerned that our son would need tooth removal or surgeries to give room for adult teeth to drop before he could even start with braces Dr. Bridgham developed a new approach to palate expansion using 3 dimensional technology to determine the use of expander and braces over two separate periods of time. This method allowed for optimal expansion of my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palate without the pain of multiple tooth extractions or surgeries. Our son was the first to receive this course of treatment from Dr. Bridgham and I now know other children who have since used this same plan with amazing results.\\nNow my youngest son needs a somewhat specialized plan for his orthodontic care. He cannot have metal work in his mouth due to the need of periodic MRI imaging of his pituitary gland. We thought Invisalign would be his only option or he would have to wait a few years to get started. I know Invisalign is a great option for many people, but it would not be the most effective approach to my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issues. Drs. Bridgham and Barr ensured us that they had this covered. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get around the metal of a palate expander but we were able to plan for its use around scheduled MRIs. In case of any emergency imaging, one of the doctors will be available for the expander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s removal and reinsertion. Just knowing that they cared enough to set up a contingency plan made moving forward an easy decision. My son just had ceramic braces placed this morning making MRI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple and much less painful then having to remove a whole set of metal braces.\\nOkay, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obvious that I trust these orthodontists with my children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s care and smiles, but I need to say a few things about their staff.\\nThey are amazing! From my very first phone call to this office years ago I have only experienced professional, friendly and caring interactions with every single employee in this office. The phones are answered, calls are returned. Scheduling appointments around a child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hectic schedule can sometimes be a nightmare. This office gets it done without any complaining. And if rescheduling needs to be done it gets done. Every part of the registration process is made easy at the first visit and then you can just breeze in and out of subsequent appointments. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to because everyone at that front desk is so pleasant.\\nAmy? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there are enough kind words to be said about this woman. She handles the financials with each family. Every step is explained thoroughly. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sign anything until Amy is sure that every question is answered. And you will smile the entire time you are in her office.\\nAnd now onto the technicians. Professional, knowledgeable and friendly are just the first words that come to mind. All three of my children have had positive experiences with these staff members. Think about that. Sitting in a dental chair can be an anxiety provoking moment for anyone and yet, my kids never complained or balked when they were reminded about an appointment. Nothing happens without a full explanation of what is about occur, why it is occurring and what to expect. If a patient seems anxious, everything is done to assure them. Nobody is ever rushed into getting the job done. So many patients and families are seen and these professionals remember little things about each of them. You know that they care.\\nMy son and daughter have beautiful smiles now and more importantly a healthy mouth and bite. I know I can expect the same for my youngest.\\nI have recommended Drs. Bridgham and Barr to friends and family and will continue to do so.\\nI think a positive experience is a great way to ensure dental compliance in children and you definitely receive that positivity in this practice.\\n'\n",

As we are in Katonah, we brought her to Bridgham-Barr. We are pleased with how Dr. Barr aligned all of our daughter's teeth without any extractions so that she will not end up with a retracted face, trouble chewing healthy food, an obstructed airway with sleep apnea, and a compensatory forward head position with kyphosis.\\nDr. Barr was understanding and did not push an artificial, Hollywood smile. Instead, her result was more naturally beautiful. \"\n",

That for me really shows how much he cares about his patients. We never had a problem scheduling regular appointments or emergency appointments. The ladies that answer the phone are always helpful and accommodating- there was the odd time where we couldn't get an after school time for an emergency appointment as I would have preferred but when you are calling somewhere the day of to be seen you don't always get to pick and choose - for the most part we were always able to be seen at a time that was convenient for us. I can't recommend Dr. Pershad enough! Thank you so much for all your hard work and dedication. My children's teeth are beautiful because of you and your staff.\"\n",

      "b'We knew that our youngest was going to need braces just like his older siblings and we always knew that the only practice we would take him to was Bridgham Barr Orthodontics. Our two older children had their orthodontic work done by Dr. Bridgham and we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been happier, not only with the end result, but with the entire process. And we have not been disappointed this time around.\\nI know children who had their braces put on at a very young age. Many of them had their braces on for years or had problems later with crowding. Dr. Bridgham and Dr. Barr don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in rushing the process. They wait for a more mature dental age to start. I truly believe this is a sign of advance orthodontristry and professionalism.\\nOur oldest child had extreme crowding due to size of his palate. Our dentist was concerned that our son would need tooth removal or surgeries to give room for adult teeth to drop before he could even start with braces Dr. Bridgham developed a new approach to palate expansion using 3 dimensional technology to determine the use of expander and braces over two separate periods of time. This method allowed for optimal expansion of my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palate without the pain of multiple tooth extractions or surgeries. Our son was the first to receive this course of treatment from Dr. Bridgham and I now know other children who have since used this same plan with amazing results.\\nNow my youngest son needs a somewhat specialized plan for his orthodontic care. He cannot have metal work in his mouth due to the need of periodic MRI imaging of his pituitary gland. We thought Invisalign would be his only option or he would have to wait a few years to get started. I know Invisalign is a great option for many people, but it would not be the most effective approach to my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issues. Drs. Bridgham and Barr ensured us that they had this covered. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get around the metal of a palate expander but we were able to plan for its use around scheduled MRIs. In case of any emergency imaging, one of the doctors will be available for the expander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s removal and reinsertion. Just knowing that they cared enough to set up a contingency plan made moving forward an easy decision. My son just had ceramic braces placed this morning making MRI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple and much less painful then having to remove a whole set of metal braces.\\nOkay, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obvious that I trust these orthodontists with my children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s care and smiles, but I need to say a few things about their staff.\\nThey are amazing! From my very first phone call to this office years ago I have only experienced professional, friendly and caring interactions with every single employee in this office. The phones are answered, calls are returned. Scheduling appointments around a child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hectic schedule can sometimes be a nightmare. This office gets it done without any complaining. And if rescheduling needs to be done it gets done. Every part of the registration process is made easy at the first visit and then you can just breeze in and out of subsequent appointments. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to because everyone at that front desk is so pleasant.\\nAmy? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there are enough kind words to be said about this woman. She handles the financials with each family. Every step is explained thoroughly. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sign anything until Amy is sure that every question is answered. And you will smile the entire time you are in her office.\\nAnd now onto the technicians. Professional, knowledgeable and friendly are just the first words that come to mind. All three of my children have had positive experiences with these staff members. Think about that. Sitting in a dental chair can be an anxiety provoking moment for anyone and yet, my kids never complained or balked when they were reminded about an appointment. Nothing happens without a full explanation of what is about occur, why it is occurring and what to expect. If a patient seems anxious, everything is done to assure them. Nobody is ever rushed into getting the job done. So many patients and families are seen and these professionals remember little things about each of them. You know that they care.\\nMy son and daughter have beautiful smiles now and more importantly a healthy mouth and bite. I know I can expect the same for my youngest.\\nI have recommended Drs. Bridgham and Barr to friends and family and will continue to do so.\\nI think a positive experience is a great way to ensure dental compliance in children and you definitely receive that positivity in this practice.\\n'\n",

If you are the kind of person who appreciates results, he is your guy. I only have two criticisms. First, his practice is very busy, so odds are that you'll be kept waiting well past your appointment. Second, there seems to be a lot of turnover amongst his support staff (at least in Silver Spring), so inexperience can play a part in mishaps. Example: failing to provide prescriptions before a scheduled surgical procedure.\\nBottom line: if you watch his staff closely and allow extra time, you'll be pleased.\\n- 10 days ago\\n5.0Mar 25, 2015\\nmargaretj, Silver Spring\\nMy care and treatment was superb in every way.

It is amazing how knowledgable and humble he is, I have been a practicing ER nurse for almost 20 years and I can greatly appreciate the professionalism of Dr.Dederich and his clinical staff. He was more than willing to spend extra time with me answering all my questions. The way he explained the surgery to my son even made him understand and put him at ease. My son was originally referred to another non specialist dentist closer to home for a consult and Dr.Dederich's fee was only about $200 more; completely worth it to see an experienced specialist. I think some of the physicians I work with could use some tips from Dr.Dederich regarding his suture work!

What a blessing! He has a new way of doing the surgery called a Tri-Correctional Bunionectomy(TCB) - a less invasive and faster healing surgery than anything I had ever heard of. After my initial consult which was very thorough and professional, including answering all my questions, I booked to have left foot ( the worst one ) done 2 weeks ago January 10th. The surgery went fast and I even watched a movie on Netflix while he did the surgery. I had a small cast around my bunion which Dr. Matthews changed last week - I was so happy when I saw that foot - it looked wonderful. But best of all I had no pain at any time - no, none, ZERO, NADA. No one believes me but my husband, but it was true!! No pain. It is important to follow the instructions that Dr. Mathews gives you about staying off your feet, elevating it etc. Very easy instructions but following them is worth it. Tomorrow I get my cast off and can start walking again. I was so happy I booked my right foot before my left foot cast came off. We need to let women know there is an alternative to the horrific bunion surgery that most women think of - this is something that women everywhere need to know about. Thank you Dr. Mathews.'\n",

      "b'Excellent Doctor, with fantastic staff. She was extremely thorough. She covered absolutely everything, both prior to pregnancy and after a confirmed pregnancy. I even recall going for a Monday morning appointment, and she noted that \"yesterday\" I was going over your chart, indicating she was reviewing patients files on a weekend! I felt very cared for by her and her staff. Due to the nature of fertility issues, experienced some lows and then fortunately the great news of being pregnant. I only wish I could have kept her as my OBGYN the entire pregnancy, but understand completely why she could not possibly take care of both the getting pregnant and seeing a patient right the way through - Fertility issues are incredibly complicated. I am glad to have had her as my doctor during a difficult struggle. Her and her staff truly go above and beyond. A VERY well run medical practise. And to those who complain that she is cold, or lacks emotion, I will say she is a very well educated medical doctor, who specializes in a very emotional specialty. If she was emotional about everything, she would not be a good doctor when it came to fertility, because things are not always rosy. She is honest and straight forward. Trust me, anyone who has ever been unfortunate enough to need her expertise will know, there are some great days in her office, and some very sad ones. Even as a patient, I can say watching some of the tears in the waiting room can be heartbreaking. Thankfully there are professionals like her to see us through. Her expertise, knowledge and medical attention will help you get pregnant, leave the hand holding to your spouse or a friend. Dr. Pyselman is highly recommended, would not have my beautiful baby without her! '\n",

We were about to give up but decided we should try another clinic and doctor before we did that. As a recommendation from my OB/Gyne we went to AFCC and Dr. Catenacci. She looked at my case and agreed that my odds weren't great but it was worth trying. We did 2 rounds of IUI unsuccessfully and then we decided we would give IVF one try. The staff at AFCC, especially Sue and Cathy, made the process so much more bearable. They answered questions and were reassuring even in the toughest times. During my IVF cycle I only grew three eggs. Their protocol is to cancel IVF if there are not a certain number/size of eggs but Dr. Catenacci gave me the option to proceed. We chose to proceed. We had two eggs retrieved and one fertilized. It was transferred on day 3 and now my beautiful, healthy, daughter is asleep next to me as I type this.

Upon first meeting Dr. Simckes, we loved him right away. He is very straight forward & didn't beat around the bush, talked to us like we were people and not just patients and didn't use much of a filter (which we loved). Let me clarify the filter part; he spoke to us like we were real people, he may have said a cuss word here or there, which made us comfortable because it meant that he was talking to us in a manner that made us comfortable and we didn't feel like he was putting on a front and trying to make himself look like an uppity doctor who was trying to sell himself. At that point, we WERE sold! After discussing our past efforts, we found out that some things our previous clinic had done were all wrong, I was even taking medication that I was not supposed to be on while trying to conceive, it was a category X drug. He explained all of our options, DID NOT try to push us in to anything, including IVF. We decided to try IUI (artificial insemination) one more time. All of the appointments were great, he was very helpful. Yes, he may have ran a little late, but name a doctor who doesn't! We were grateful for his help and didn't mind waiting, his help far outweighed the time spent on waiting. My partner chose to carry, since Dr. Simckes said it was a healthier choice since I am diabetic. She wound up ovulating on a Saturday night. We corresponded with Dr. Simckes, who was at a wedding reception that evening and he wound up meeting us at the office around 7:30pm for the insemination. It was great that he took the time to go out of his way for us instead of saying that he was off the clock! Bada bing......two weeks later, we found out that we were pregnant! He spent the next 10 weeks making sure the baby was doing well before sending us off to our OBGYN, making sure we could see and understand what was going on in the static screen of the ultrasound every time. We wound up having a beautiful, healthy little girl! We never felt like he was money hungry, he gave us options that were as affordable as possible and never rushed us in to IVF. He was upfront about his fees right away and did everything he could to save us money wherever possible. His sense of humor is fantastic (as long as you're not too uptight) and we really felt like he was involved in our whole experience and not just a doctor who got the job done! Needless to say, I would recommend Dr. Simckes to anyone having fertility issues.\"\n",

His success rate speaks volume. Their pregnancy rate in the first three months of this year was 92%.\\n2) Gentle hand. I commented to Dr Pabon that it never hurt when he does an exam or even the IVF procedures, while I feel more of a routine exam from some other doctors. Dr Pabon\\'s response is something I will remember: some doctors forget that what they do everyday is not what a patient is used to. Dr Pabon does not forget that.\\n3) Excellent embryologist and support staff. Everyone knows you by the name. You don\\'t have to repeat things. And you don\\'t have to worry about getting a procedure from a doctor you have not met or who only has a few minutes to review your chart before the procedure.\\nWe truly believe that Dr Pabon is the very best Infertility Doctor, with a highly efficient team that makes wonderful things happen.

      "b'If you have a child who may require surgery, I encourage you to research the pediatric services offered by Kalispell Reg\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Medical Center. Upon my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial Crohn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diagnosis eight months ago, I began researching facilities in the Northwest and the US. As part of the due diligence, my son was seen by a director at another nationally recognized facility in anticipation that I may seek care outside the Flathead. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have hesitated to go outside the Flathead if I thought it was best for my son, as we do for my husband who has a chronic disease. Surprisingly, my due diligence revealed that many pediatric specialists at Kalispell Regional Medical Center have comparable education, training and experience as many of the pediatric specialists at the best children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hospitals in the country.\\nAfter thoughtful consideration, we determined it was best for my son if he had the surgery in Montana with Dr. Seifarth. In fact, if Dr. Seifarth did not practice in Kalispell, we may have flown to Cleveland Clinic (his previous location) to seek him out. While the entire pediatric team was quite impressive, I will speak specifically to Dr. Seifarth since this is a review for him. (I would be remiss not to at least mention his nurse practitioner, Rachel, who is a wonderful complement to Dr. Seifarth and is deserving of her own glowing review for many reasons.) Although I knew of Dr. Seifarth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputation, training and experience prior to my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment, the pre-operative appointment cemented the deal so to speak. Dr. Seifarth was the right surgeon for us. In the weeks after our first appointment with Dr. Seifarth, our confidence in our decision grew as we prepared for surgery. Looking back on the initial re-sectioning surgery and the weeks of Crohn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-induced complications, including an emergency surgery and a month in the hospital, we firmly believe we could not have placed our son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s young life in the hands of a better surgeon.\\nOver the course of a month under Dr. Seifarth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daily care (as well as other staff on the team), I was able to observe Dr. Seifarth and the team under a variety of circumstances --- a major surgery that was supposed to include a fairly quick recovery, the realization that something was very wrong requiring an immediate follow-up surgery (ostomy), the insertion of four drains over the course of two weeks, struggles with my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reporting of pain, daily follow-up visits during rounds, etc. -- I observed Dr. Seifarth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consistent demeanor in calm times and in stressful times.\\nDr. Seifarth is extremely competent (research his training and experience for yourself). He took time to explain things in a way that an inquisitive and capable mom would understand and then in a way that a 12-year-old boy would understand (he draws pictures and uses kid-friendly terms). He invited and answered questions. He was humble and at ease. I imagine anyone who spends a little time with him would think he was a good guy. He has a bedside manner that makes it apparent that pediatrics is his love. He developed a relationship with my son (not through me, but by talking directly to my son and respecting him as the patient). For example, I observed him joke often with my son, tell goofy stories, show him photos of his pets, and talk about his own children. He encouraged my son on the worst days and had fun with him on the best days. He treated my son as though my son was his most important patient. Never once in the month we were in the hospital did he seem rushed or like he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have all the time in the world for my son.\\nI am so grateful that KMRC has chosen to invest so much time, money, and energy into developing a pediatric unit that can service families in Montana without the need to go out-of-state. I am grateful that our beautiful surroundings (Glacier Park, Big Mountain, Flathead Lake, etc.) help entice highly-qualified doctors from all over the country to choose to practice here. I simply did not have an appreciation of what was happening in my own community until my family was thrust into the middle of this chronic disease. I encourage you to investigate the pediatric offerings at KMRC before going out of state.'\n",

      "b'It turns out that Dr Wong has quite a following in Kelowna and I had been recommended to see her by a few friends to try to deal with my problem belly fat that clearly no amount of gym training or disciplined eating have been able to keep under control. I went to see her for an initial consultation and after learning about my medical and lifestyle history, she recommended a very safe and non-invasive FDA-approved treatment known as \\xe2\\x80\\x98cool sculpting\\xe2\\x80\\x99. I was initially apprehensive to have the procedure performed, thinking that it was some sort of gimmick. I was then latterly concerned about any possible pain, discomfort and potential bruising. Dr Wong very thoughtfully and attentively allayed my concerns by explaining thoroughly what to expect at each step of the way and the scientific theory and nature of the technology. I therefore decided to give it a try given how impressed I was with both Dr Wong and her friendly staff and in particular, by how many people were waiting in the waiting room when I went for my consultation (a dozen people waiting in the waiting room couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be wrong, I thought!). I was then treated by one of her technicians, Karen, who was very warm, friendly and expertly knowledgable, who ran the whole process efficiently and effectively. Suffice it to say, I was deliriously happy with the results and have been back for multiple treatments since. I now almost compulsively recommend Dr Wong to anyone who will listen. Having had treatments done at the world famous Harley Street clinics in London, England and in Paris, I can honestly say that her service - and indeed the architecture and decor of her beautiful clinic - are of an international calibre and Kelowna is so very lucky to have such an expert and such a service available there (at a mere fraction of the price of London or Paris at that!). She could very easily set up a thriving practice in London or Paris given the service and the results that she provides. I am very looking forward to my next treatment the next time I am back in Kelowna.'\n",

      "b'I have been seeing Dr. Wong for over 10 years. When I first went to see her, my legs were a mess of ropey veins after having three kids. We had quite a few sessions at first as she tackled the veins one section at a time. I remember being nervous about the needles and pain, but Dr. Wong is very reassuring and caring. There were times I called the office worried about the tender lumps in my legs where the injections were done, or where I saw some redness. The staff has always been great about getting me in to see Dr. Wong on short notice. Sometimes the lumps were drained of some old blood, which gave a lot of relief. It was explained to me that when the veins are closed by medication, the veins can become inflamed and red, and there can be blood trapped inside which causes the pain. I was reassured that the body would absorb the blood and the vein in time. Sure enough, with time, the veins and lumps have disappeared. I only see Dr. Wong once a year now, just for a tune up to keep on top of things - I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go back to where I started. I have just visited her new office for the first time. I was floored at how beautiful it is and it was so great to see so many familiar faces.

I saw her because I had numbness in my lateral calf muscle and worried my disc herniation had returned and was the cause of the numbness. She did an ultrasound to the area (which was convenient as the wait to get an ultrasound is 2 months). From this she was able to tell me that one of my veins wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing too well, and was the cause of the numbness/pain.

After the second visit I was already recommending her to my friends that are thinking of moving here too, and I plan on continuing to do so.\\nNever before have I been treated with such kindness and warmth in a dental office. In my previous experiences involving dentists, you come in, sit down, and somebody does whatever they're going to do with your teeth (and then you pay and leave). Sometimes, there is pain or discomfort, and for a lot of people (myself included) very frequently there is some level of anxiety. Not at this office.\\nHere, there's an incredible level of genuine care for you as a person first and foremost; you begin with a thorough and personalized getting-to-know-you session, and every procedure that follows comes with a sit-down talk to explain both the situation and your options on how to handle it, along with printed information sheets (about everything!) to take home if any further knowledge is helpful to have. Your input during the visit is absolutely welcome, and asking questions is actively encouraged. Even the clinic itself doesn't leave you feeling like you're in a traditional dental office - it is a beautiful, clean, welcoming space with a genuinely homey feel and comfortable vibe. The staff are helpful and friendly, and the punctuality of everyone there is impeccable; I have never had to wait more than a minute or two after showing up to end up in a dental chair. And once I'm in that chair, I am treated with unparalleled courtesy and respect.\\nAt first, all I went in for was a routine cleaning and a check-up regarding a small spot I saw on one of my back teeth. Dr. Shirley explained to me what it was, and remedied the situation with speed and professionalism. She was so gentle that I experienced no discomfort during the procedure whatsoever, and my previously bothersome dental anxiety vanished in the face of her compassionate and patient demeanour. Since that first visit, I've been receiving help managing --and thus far actually just completely eliminating, which is incredible-- the migraine headaches that have been robbing me of my ability to function as I have always wanted to. As someone who has lived with debilitating chronic illness for the majority of my life, I would have never believed a pain-free day was possible. Thanks to this clinic and the supportive device they have custom-made me for my jaw, I have been able to remove one more hurdle from my daily life and learned just how wonderful it is to feel a little bit more of what everybody else gets to feel day to day.\\nIt is an absolute joy to have Dr. Shirley Cheong as my dentist, and I am so thankful there is someone looking out for my health with this much empathy and care.\\n\"\n",

I waited couple of minutes and I was then taken to the back for one set of XRAY and basically as the pictures came on I already could see what the problem is with the previous work I had have done. BTW the dental assistance here are super friendly and really treat you well in all stages of the work.\\nThen I got the pleasure of meeting Dr. Deheshi, in simple words, he is a confident dentist. Right off the back he took time to hear my story and took my dental history, he then examined the x rays and my tooth and walked me through what has been causing the issues. For one thing he was first in his graduating class and honestly it shows that he loves what he does and more importantly he is up to date with the knowledge and techniques necessary to make your experience wonderful.\\nHe laid out a clear plan for me and yesterday we did the fillings. for one thing he took time and was patient enough to ensure I am fully frozen, he knew I have been through hell and back so he honestly give his full attention to the work and so far it has been a day since it is all finished- no pain, no sharp edges, perfect hight adjustment and all in all very happy with the way he made everything... the best part is that I feel nothing throughout the whole procedure and in fact enjoyed my time there very much.\\nThe most important part is that within few hours post work I started to feel relief and it seems that it is going towards complete recovery and good state... Anyways whatever the outcome I will continue working with Dr. Deheshi as he truly loves his job and is meticulous in the way he performed his work.\\n100% recommend him! cant go wrong with this guy and his lovely staff!\\n\"\n",

She is a joy to spend time with. I have done countless procedures from gum surgeries to root canals and have never feared going in because of his professionalism and his warm and gentle nature.
